Promotional channels are available to everyone, but you can also earn new ranks by chatting and being active on the server. As you rank up you will unlock new channels, and the higher you rank, the less competitive the promotional channels will be. You can check your current rank by going to <#837945839799500850> and typing \`/rank\`

                `**When/how can I self promote?**
> All self-promotion channels can be found under the ‘SELF PROMOTE’ section. Self-promotion channels are unlocked at Rank 0. Reaching higher ranks allows you to self-promote in less competitive channels, allowing your content to be seen easier by others. You can bypass rank requirements by becoming a **Server Booster**. You can check your current rank by going to <#837945839799500850> and typing \`/rank\`
⠀
**Can I promote my own server or paid service?**
> Advertising, as well as looking for other discord servers, paid services and products, or promotional content not related to content creation is only permitted in <#907446635435540551>. There are some fees for creating an advertisement of this kind so please refer to [this post](<https://discord.com/channels/820889004055855144/907446635435540551/907463741174587473>) or DM **ProbablyRaging** for more information
⠀
**What does server boosting do?**
> Server boosting is a fun way to support CreatorHub by helping us unlock awesome server perks. On top of that, becoming a **Server Booster** allows you to bypass most of the rank requirements on the server and you also get some extra perks which you can find by going to <#837945839799500850> and typing \`+boost\`
⠀`,

                `**How do I rank up?**
> Upon joining the server you will be 'unranked' or 'rank 0'. Every minute that you're chatting in the server, you randomly gain between 15 and 25 XP that goes towards your rank. The next ranks are Rank 5, Rank 10, Rank 15.. and so on, increasing by increments of 5. The higher you rank, the more server features you unlock, such as, less competitive promotional channels, game channels, permission to post links outside of the 'SELF PROMOTE' section. To avoid spamming, earning XP is limited to once a minute per user. You can check your current rank by going to <#837945839799500850> and typing \`/rank\`
                    
**How do I link my channels/socials?**
> Linking your channels/socials to your Discord profile makes it easier for other people to find your content. To link them; in the bottom left of Discord, go to **Settings :gear: > Connections**
⠀
**How can I get more subs/followers/views?**
> There is no simple answer to this question, but we always recommend people start by researching SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO such as using good keywords, thumbnails, titles and descriptions can drastically improve the chances of YouTube and Google choosing your content to fill their search results when someone makes a search request using keywords that you've used. Find more information in <#851707143873626134> and do your own research
⠀`,

                `**Will people here actually watch my videos?**
> This server's sole purpose isn't for self promotion, it's just one of the benefits. Think of it as another way to get eyes on your content, but keep in mind that most of us here are also content creators so we're probably not your target audience, that doesn't mean people wont watch them. The community members here are super supportive to those who are active, helpful and supportive to others
⠀
**Why do people keep DMing me spam and promo content?**
> Unfortunately this is just a part of Discord. We try to remove as many of these spam accounts as possible, but we also recommend you disable DMs from people you aren't friends with, by going to **Settings :gear: > Privacy & Safety** and disabling the option to allow DMs from server members
⠀
**How can I report someone for breaking the rules?**
> To make a report, you can send a DM including any screenshots to <@841409086960697385> and one of the staff members will review it. If the matter is more urgent, you can ping a staff member or one of the staff roles`
