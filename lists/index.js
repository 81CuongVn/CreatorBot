                `**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**
**When/how can I share my content?**
> Content share channels can be found under the 'CONTENT SHARE' section. Content share channels are unlocked at Rank 5. Reaching Rank 5 and unlocking the 'CONTENT SHARE' channels takes approximately 80 messages *(or 1 hour of total chat time)*. You can bypass these rank requirements by becoming a **Server Booster**. You can check your current rank by going to <#837945839799500850> and typing \`/rank\`

**Can I advertise my own server or paid service?**
> Advertising, as well as looking for other discord servers, paid services and products, or promotional content not related to content creation is only permitted in <#907446635435540551>. There are some fees for creating an advertisement of this kind so please refer to [this post](<https://discord.com/channels/820889004055855144/907446635435540551/907463741174587473>) or DM <@438434841617367080> for more information

**What does server boosting do?**
> Server boosting is a fun way to support CreatorHub by helping us unlock awesome server perks. On top of that, becoming a **Server Booster** allows you to bypass most of the rank requirements on the server and you also get some extra perks which you can find by typing \`/boost\`

**How do I rank up?**
> Upon joining the server you will be 'unranked' or 'rank 0'. Every minute that you're chatting in the server, you randomly gain between 15 and 25 XP that goes towards your rank. The next ranks are Rank 5, Rank 10, Rank 15.. and so on, increasing by increments of 5. The higher you rank, the more server features you unlock, such as, content share channels, game channels, permission to post links outside of the 'CONTENT SHARE' section, etc. To avoid spamming, earning XP is limited to once a minute per user. You can check your current rank by going to <#837945839799500850> and typing \`/rank\`. *You will not gain XP for posting messages in the CONTENT SHARE section!*

                `**How do I link my channels/socials?**
> Linking your channels/socials to your Discord profile makes it easier for other people to find your content. To link them; in the bottom left of Discord, go to **Settings :gear: > Connections**
 
**How can I get more subs/followers/views?**
> There is no simple answer to this question, but we always recommend people start by researching SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SEO such as using good keywords, thumbnails, titles and descriptions can drastically improve the chances of YouTube and Google choosing your content to fill their search results when someone makes a search request using keywords that you've used. Find more information in <#851707143873626134> and do your own research

**Will people here actually watch my videos?**
> This server's sole purpose isn't for self promotion, it's just one of the benefits. Think of it as another way to get eyes on your content, but keep in mind that most of us here are also content creators so we're probably not your target audience, that doesn't mean people wont watch them. The community members here are super supportive to those who are active, helpful and supportive to others

**Why do people keep DMing me spam and promo content?**
> Unfortunately this is just a part of Discord. We try to remove as many of these spam accounts as possible, but we also recommend you disable DMs from people you aren't friends with, by going to **Settings :gear: > Privacy & Safety** and disabling the option to allow DMs from server members
⠀`,

                `**How can I apply for a staff role?**
> We are always accepting new applications for staff members. If you think you would make a good addition to the team, you can apply by using the \`/apply\` command and filling out the required information. To apply, you must be Rank 10 or higher. Applications are accepted and denied privately and we don't provide notification of an application being denied. If your application is accepted however, a staff member will contact you to discuss further

**How can I report someone for breaking the rules?**
> To make a report, you can use the \`/report\` command and one of the staff members will review it. Be sure to include any screenshots in your report. If the matter is more urgent, you can ping a staff member or one of the staff roles`
